# flight-controller-sensors
 Prepares stable sensor data to be used for the flight controller

Currently, this app is still under development but the things that you can expect in the future are:

-- Output filtered accelerometer data to be used with the motors.
-- Find a way to interact with the speed controller using the USB port.

This readme will be updated as the project evolves.
